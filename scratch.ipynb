The feeling trembling beneath the fact &#8212; the brutal knowledge that everything we love is irreplaceable yet will be lost: to dissolution and death, to rejection and indifference, to our own return to stardust &#8212; is the hardest thing to bear, the thing for which we have devised <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/04/25/ernest-becker-heroism/\">our most elaborate theaters of denial</a>. </p>\\n<p>Among those coping mechanisms is the invention of sentimentality. &#8220;Sentimentality is a superstructure covering brutality,&#8221; Carl Jung wrote. Its strange psychological machinery is what the poet Mark Doty explores with uncommon insight and sensitivity in a passage from his wonderful memoir <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dog-Years-Memoir-Mark-Doty/dp/0061171018/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Dog Years</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/69792686\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>). </p>\\n<p>He writes:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>The oversweetened surface of the sentimental exists in order to protect its maker, as well as the audience, from anger. At the beautiful image refusing to hold, at the tenderness we bring to the objects of the world &#8212; our eagerness to love, make home, build connection, trust the other &#8212; how all of that’s so readily swept away. Sentimental images of children and of animals, sappy representations of love &#8212; they are fueled, in truth, by their opposites, by a terrible human rage that nothing stays. The greeting card verse, the airbrushed rainbow, the sweet puppy face on the fleecy pink sweatshirt &#8212; these images do not honor the world as it is, in its complexity and individuality, but distort things in apparent service of a warm embrace. They feel empty because they will not acknowledge the inherent anger that things are not as shown; the world, in their terms, is not a universe of individuals but a series of interchangeable instances of charm. It is necessary to assert the insignificance of individuality to make mortality bearable. In this way, the sentimental represents a rage against individuality, the singular, the irreplaceable. (<em>Why don’t you just get another dog?</em>) The anger that lies beneath the sentimental accounts for its weird hollowness. But it is, I supposed, easier to feel than what lies beneath rage: the terror of emptiness, of waste, of the absence of meaning or value; the empty space of our own death, neither comprehensible nor representable.</p></blockquote>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_64211\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/04/11/leaves-of-grass-margaret-cook/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64211\" height=\"851\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass25.jpg?resize=680%2C851&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Margaret C.

Every creative act is an act of consolation for our transience, for our despair about our transience. A century after Albert Camus insisted that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/11/30/albert-camus-travel-lyrical-critical-essays/\">&#8220;there is no love of life without despair of life,&#8221;</a> Doty contemplates this fundamental equivalence of existence:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Despair, I think, is the fruit of a refusal to accept our mortal situation. Perhaps it’s less passive than it may seem; is despair a deep assertion of will? The stubborn self saying, <em>I will not have it, I do not accept it</em>. <em>Fine</em>, says the world, <em>don’t accept it</em>. The collective continues; the whole goes on, while each part slips away.

Within five centuries of its invention, Egyptian pottery was making ample and dazzling use of cobalt glass. And then, after the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt at the end of the Late Bronze Age, it suddenly vanished &#8212; after 1250 BC, both cobalt and glass almost completely disappear from the archeological record.

What elemental hunger for beauty drove them then to add this strange creation to that supreme triumph of human genius, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/06/23/stuff-matters-miodownik-glass/\">glass</a>? </p>\\n<p>How they too must have gasped when the sun first shone through it. </p>\\n<p>Cupping this blue marvel in my hand, I feel instantly connected to that anonymous ancestor, connected to the entire lineage of human curiosity and creativity that made so improbable and lovely a thing consecrate an ordinary afternoon with wonder.

Eventually, the sun bleaches out the parts of the paper not covered, leaving an imprint of the photopositive object in the color of the pigment used in the coating &#8212; a ghostly beauty with the chromatic quality of a watercolor and the feeling-tone of a poem. </p>\\n<p>On the first of January the following year, Somerville&#8217;s results were published as <em>On the Action of the Rays of the Spectrum on Vegetable Juices</em> in the <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</em> &#8212; not under her own name, since women could not publish in scientific journals, but under Herschel&#8217;s, who gave her full credit. </p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_59154\"><img alt=\"Mary Somerville (Portrait by Thomas Phillips)\" class=\"size-full wp-image-59154\" height=\"827\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/marysomerville.jpg?resize=680%2C827&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mary Somerville (Portrait by Thomas Phillips)</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Condensing the solar spectrum through a lens of flint glass and projecting it through a pinhole onto thick white letter paper washed with various pigments and compounds &#8212; from &#8220;the velvety petals of a scarlet geranium&#8221; to the juice of the beet-root &#8212; Somerville discovered that the juices of the same plant produce different colors depending on what portion of the spectrum they are exposed to and whether they are extracted with water or alcohol. Some of the results were entirely counterintuitive, rendering colors very different from those of the flower &#8212; the dark orange nasturtium, for instance, turned the paper Prussian blue when exposed to light. Somerville marveled at how &#8220;the action of the different parts of the spectrum seems very capricious&#8221; &#8212; a delightful unpredictability that recurred across all of her experiments. She wrote of one:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>The juice of the petals of pale blue <em>Plumbago auriculata</em> in distilled water imparted its tint to writing-paper, which, after exposure to the action of diffused light, acquired a pale yellowish green hue. The part under the lavender and violet rays of the spectrum, repeatedly washed with the juice, assumed a pale brown colour: the indigo rays seemed to have no effect, although from their lowest edge to the distance of half the length of the spectrum below the red rays, a lavender blue image was formed. Under the orange rays a minute indigo-coloured spot appeared, and also a larger spot of the same colour under the yellow, which were soon blended into one, forming a single oblong figure of maximum intensity, surrounded by a halo of paler indigo </p></blockquote>\\n<p>This was entirely new insight into the interaction of photons and organic molecules, into the materiality of beauty, into how nature works. Mary Somerville had chipped another fragment of knowledge from the monolith of mystery &#8212; the task and measure of the true scientist. </p>\\n<p>But as commerce interceded with creativity and the seeds of our insta-culture were planted, the much faster &#8212; and much more toxic &#8212; chemical imaging processes like daguerreotype and tintype became favored over the slow, gentle work of sunlit flowers. </p>\\n<p>Expelled from the realm of science and commercial technology, anthotypes became the province of artists. </p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_61497\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-61497\" height=\"814\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/emilydickinson.jpg?resize=680%2C814&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily Dickinson, daguerreotype, ca. 1847.

Metabolically costly since the start, producing blossoms to attract pollinators is now becoming prodigal as pollinator populations are rapidly declining. Instead of relying on pollinators, many bisexual species &#8212; the botanical term for which is <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/07/02/perfect-flowers-emily-dickison/\"><em>perfect flowers</em></a> &#8212; are evolving to fertilize their own seeds with their own pollen: a process known as <em>selfing</em>. Its haunting downside is that, because <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/01/02/the-snail-with-the-right-heart/\">diversity is nature&#8217;s fulcrum of resilience</a>, flowers pollinated by selfing replicate their own genes in the next generation of seeds, amplifying their existing vulnerabilities to disease and drought &#8212; something cross-pollination prevents by mixing the DNA of different plants into new, adaptive combinations of genes.

Some of them are healing and some damaging. Some are easy to recognize for what they are &#8212; almost all isms are damaging myths. But some are more subtle, more pernicious, permeating the substratum of culture and the marrow of the psyche. </p>\\n<p>One of Western culture&#8217;s most damaging myths, largely inherited from the Romantics, is that of the tortured genius &#8212; the suffering artist who needs to have suffered and must go on suffering in order to create works of beauty and poignancy, portals to the sacred. The truth, of course, is far more nuanced &#8212; artists are simply people who feel life deeply in all of its dimensions, who are awake and alive to both its tragedy and its transcendence, who put their heightened sensitivity in the service of wakefulness and aliveness for others. </p>\\n<p>Virginia Woolf knew this when she wrote of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/09/09/virginia-woolf-cotton-wool-moments-of-being/\">the shock-receiving capacity</a> necessary for being an artist. In his diary, Walt Whitman contemplated the superior porousness of the creative spirit to both life&#8217;s “sunny expanses and sky-reaching heights” and its &#8220;bare spots and darknesses,&#8221; believing that &#8220;no artist or work of the very first class may be or can be without them.” </p>\\n<p>These, of course, are the polarities we all live with, the polarities that live in us, which Maya Angelou channeled in her stunning poem <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/05/09/a-brave-and-startling-truth-maya-angelou/\">&#8220;A Brave and Startling Truth.&#8221;</a> The artist is humanity&#8217;s magnifying lens for the inherent dualities of human nature &#8212; something James Baldwin captured in his insistence that an artist&#8217;s role is <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/05/24/james-baldwin-life-magazine-1963/\">&#8220;to make you realize the doom and glory of knowing who you are and what you are.&#8221;</a> The measure of our creative vitality lies in how intimately we contact both the doom and the glory of being, what we make of the restless tension between our own poles, how we harmonize them into something beautiful. </p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_66531\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66531\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/hermannhesse_large3.jpg?resize=680%2C960&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hermann Hesse</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>In the interlude between two world wars, as humanity hungered for beauty to controvert its own brutality, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/hermann-hesse/\">Hermann Hesse</a> (July 2, 1877&ndash;August 9, 1962) considered the inner life of the creative spirit in a poignant passage from his 1927 novel <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Steppenwolf-Novel-Hermann-Hesse/dp/0312278675/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Steppenwolf</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/698117126\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>), painting the artist as a divided creature that yearns for wholeness and turns that yearning into the creative act:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Many artists&#8230; have two souls, two beings within them. There is God and the devil in them; the mother’s blood and the father’s; the capacity for happiness and the capacity for suffering; and in just such a state of enmity and entanglement towards and within each other as were the wolf and man.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>For Hesse&#8217;s artist, riven by these inner tensions, &#8220;life has no repose.&#8221; And yet out of that restlessness comes the artist&#8217;s gift to the world:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>[Artists] live at times in their rare moments of happiness with such strength and indescribable beauty, the spray of their moment’s happiness is flung so high and dazzlingly over the wide sea of suffering, that the light of it, spreading its radiance, touches others too with its enchantment. Thus, like a precious, fleeting foam over the sea of suffering arise all those works of art, in which a single individual lifts himself for an hour so high above his personal destiny that his happiness shines like a star and appears to all who see it as something eternal and as a happiness of their own.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Complement with other excellent reflections on what it means to be an artist from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/02/09/e-e-cummings-miscellany-agony-of-the-artist/\">e.e. cummings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/02/25/m-c-richards-centering-creativity/\">M.C.

Some stem from myths and folk beliefs about birds dating back centuries, to a time when Satan was realer than gravity in the human mind, Kepler&#8217;s mother could be <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/12/26/katharina-kepler-witchcraft-dream/\">tried for witchcraft</a>, and superstition was the primary sensemaking tool for causality &#8212; an organizing principle for life, reflected in language: &#8220;a murder of crows&#8221; alludes to various superstitions about crows as emissaries of death, believed capable of killing their own kind in punishment for transgression; &#8220;a parliament of owls&#8221; draws on ancient Greek mythology, in which an owl accompanies Athena &#8212; the goddess of wisdom and reason, representing freedom and democracy across the Western world. </p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTZMF6/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81715\" height=\"549\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/brianwildsmith_birds_ravens.jpg?resize=680%2C549&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a></p>\\n<p>A great many of these company terms originate in one of the first books printed in English after the invention of the Gutenberg Press: the <em>Boke of Seynt Albans</em> [<em>Book of Saint Albans</em>], also known as <em>The Book of Hawking, Hunting, and Blasing of Arms</em>. Anonymously published in 1486 and written largely in verse, it was lauded as the work of “a gentleman of excellent gifts&#8221; &#8212; until it was discovered that the author was a woman named Juliana Barnes. </p>\\n<p>Like <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/11/17/octavio-paz-sor-juana/\">Sor Juana</a> two centuries later, Juliana had suffered some great unnamed heartbreak that led her to retreat to a cloister, where she immersed herself in study &#8212; convents were often the only way women could access books in an era when formal education was entirely closed to them. Like Montaigne, she became a prolific diarist. Having refined herself as a writer on these private pages, she began writing for the public &#8212; an act of tremendous courage and confidence for a woman in the fifteenth century to begin with, and doubly so given she chose to write about masculine endeavors: hunting, fishing, hawking. </p>\\n<p>Tucked into the middle of her book is a long list of company terms under the heading &#8220;THE COMPAYNYS OF BEESTYS AND FOWLYS.&#8221; Discernible through the confounding Old English, through the bastarda blackletter script barely legible to modern eyes, are the charming &#8220;exaltation of larks&#8221; (<em>Exaltyng of Larkis</em>), &#8220;murmuration of starlings&#8221; (<em>Murmuration of Stares</em>), &#8220;watch of nightingales&#8221; (<em>Wache of Nyghtingalis</em>), &#8220;sedge of herons&#8221; (<em>Sege of heronnys</em>), &#8220;gaggle of geese&#8221; (<em>Gagle of gees</em>), and &#8220;unkindness of ravens&#8221; (<em>unkyndenes of Ravenes</em>), all still in use today.</p>\\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81704\" height=\"944\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/beestys1.jpg?resize=680%2C944&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></p>\\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81703\" height=\"944\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/beesty2.jpg?resize=680%2C944&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></p>\\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81702\" height=\"944\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/beestys3.jpg?resize=680%2C944&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></p>\\n<p>Half a millennium after Juliana Barnes died an unknown nun in an English convent on a planet without clocks, calculus, or democracy that thought itself the center of the universe, the English painter and children&#8217;s book illustrator Brian Wildsmith (January 22, 1930&ndash;August 31, 2016) brought to life the loveliest of these company terms in the 1967 gem <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTZMF6/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Birds by Brian Wildsmith</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/306437\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTZMF6/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81732\" height=\"439\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/brianwildsmith_birds20_1.jpg?resize=680%2C439&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a></p>\\n<p>Not all of these terms have remained the same across space and time &#8212; different eras and different regions have devised their own strange and wondrous lexicon for the same bird groupings.

(As with Rumi, as with the gospels, one need not share Wiman&#8217;s particular flavor of faith to be moved by the spiritual truth in his writing.) </p>\\n<p>In consonance with the science of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/06/25/limbic-revision/\">limbic revision</a> and its haunting corollary that &#8220;who we are and who we become depends, in part, on whom we love,&#8221; he writes:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>There is a sense in which love’s truth is proved by its end, by what it becomes in us, and what we, by virtue of love, become. But love, like faith, occurs in the innermost recesses of a person’s spirit, and we can see only inward in this regard, and not very clearly.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>With an eye to his own experience, he considers how any large and luminous love transcends the personal &#8212; the realm of the self &#8212; and unselves us into the sacred:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I did not know what love was until I encountered one that kept opening and opening and opening. And until I acknowledged that what that love was opening onto, and into, was God&#8230; In any true love &#8212; a mother’s for her child, a husband’s for his wife, a friend’s for a friend &#8212; there is an excess energy that always wants to be in motion. Moreover, it seems to move not simply from one person to another but through them, toward something else&#8230; This is why we can be so baffled and overwhelmed by such love&#8230; It wants to be more than it is; it cries out inside of us to make it more than it is. And what it is crying out for, finally, is its essence and origin: God.</p></blockquote>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_77644\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/the-dove-no-1-by-hilma-af-klint-1915_print?curator=brainpicker\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77644\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/HilmaAfKlint_Dove_small.jpg?resize=680%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>The Dove No. 1</em> by Hilma af Klint, 1915.

Surrendering to it &#8212; to this transcendent not-knowing that beckons beyond the bounds of what we can hold on to &#8212; may be the essence of love. Wiman writes:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Love, which awakens our souls and to which we cling like the splendid mortal creatures that we are, asks us to let it go, to let it be more than it is&#8230; We feel love leave us in unthreatening ways. We feel it reenter us at once more truly and more strange, like a simple kiss that has a bite of starlight to it.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Perhaps this spiritual dimension of love stems from a simple equivalence: At its core, love is the quality of attention we confer upon another; and as Simone Weil observed in <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/08/19/simone-weil-attention-gravity-and-grace/\">her timeless meditation on the nature of grace</a>, &#8220;attention, taken to its highest degree, is the same thing as prayer.&#8221; All of love&#8217;s gravity and all of its grace are found in our acts of attention. </p>\\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).

The mountains seem to waver as though they were huge dark ships on a distant voyage. I love to climb up into the silence of these vast autonomous structures. What seems like a pinnacled summit from beneath becomes a level plateau when you arrive there. Born in a red explosion of ascending fire, the granite lies cold, barely marked by the millions of years of rain and wind. On this primeval ground I feel I have entered into a pristine permanence, a continuity here that knew the wind hundreds of millions of years before a human face ever felt it. </p>\\n<p>When we arrive into the world, we enter this ancient sequence. All our beginnings happen within this continuity. Beginnings often frighten us because they seem like lonely voyages into the unknown. Yet, in truth, no beginning is empty or isolated. We seem to think that beginning is setting out from a lonely point along some line of direction into the unknown. This is not the case. Shelter and energy come alive when a beginning is embraced&#8230; We are never as alone in our beginnings as it might seem at the time. A beginning is ultimately an invitation to open toward the gifts and growth that are stored up for us. To refuse to begin can be an act of great self-neglect.</p>\\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\\n<p>Our very life here depends directly on continuous acts of beginning.</p></blockquote>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_81674\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/wanderer-above-the-sea-of-fog-der-wanderer-uber-dem-nebelmeer-by-caspar-david-friedrich-circa-1817_print?curator=brainpicker\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81674\" height=\"872\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Friedrich_Wanderer.jpg?resize=680%2C872&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Wanderer above the Sea of Fog</em> (<em>Der Wanderer über dem Nebelmeer</em>) by Caspar David Friedrich, circa 1817.

Risk might be our greatest ally. To live a truly creative life, we always need to cast a critical look at where we presently are, attempting always to discern where we have become stagnant and where new beginning might be ripening. There can be no growth if we do not remain open and vulnerable to what is new and different.

O&#8217;Donohue considers what it takes to override our creaturely reflex for habituation:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Sometimes the greatest challenge is to actually begin; there is something deep in us that conspires with what wants to remain within safe boundaries and stay the same&#8230; Sometimes a period of preparation is necessary, where the idea of the beginning can gestate and refine itself; yet quite often we unnecessarily postpone and equivocate when we should simply take the risk and leap into a new beginning.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>He renders the vulnerability and redemption of that leap in a poem &#8212; a kind of self-blessing to consecrate the courage of beginning:</p>\\n<blockquote><p><strong>FOR A NEW BEGINNING</strong><br />\\n<em>by John O&#8217;Donohue</em></p>\\n<p>In out-of-the-way places of the heart,<br />\\nWhere your thoughts never think to wander,<br />\\nThis beginning has been quietly forming,<br />\\nWaiting until you were ready to emerge. </p>\\n<p>For a long time it has watched your desire,<br />\\nFeeling the emptiness growing inside you,<br />\\nNoticing how you willed yourself on,<br />\\nStill unable to leave what you had outgrown. </p>\\n<p>It watched you play with the seduction of safety<br />\\nAnd the gray promises that sameness whispered,<br />\\nHeard the waves of turmoil rise and relent,<br />\\nWondered would you always live like this. </p>\\n<p>Then the delight, when your courage kindled,<br />\\nAnd out you stepped onto new ground,<br />\\nYour eyes young again with energy and dream,<br />\\nA path of plenitude opening before you. </p>\\n<p>Though your destination is not yet clear<br />\\nYou can trust the promise of this opening;<br />\\nUnfurl yourself into the grace of beginning<br />\\nThat is at one with your life’s desire. </p>\\n<p>Awaken your spirit to adventure;<br />\\nHold nothing back, learn to find ease in risk;<br />\\nSoon you will be home in a new rhythm,<br />\\nFor your soul senses the world that awaits you.</p></blockquote>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_76829\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/05/12/sophie-blackall-things-to-look-forward-to/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76829\" height=\"817\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sophieblackall_thingstolookforwardto_Songs.jpg?resize=680%2C817&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Sophie Blackall from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/05/12/sophie-blackall-things-to-look-forward-to/\"><em>Things to Look Forward to</em></a> &#8212; an illustrated celebration of living with presence in uncertain times.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Sometimes &#8212; in fact, often &#8212; beginnings are tucked into endings.

When the heart is ready for a fresh beginning, unforeseen things can emerge. And in a sense, this is exactly what a beginning does. It is an opening for surprises.

(James Webb Space Telescope / NASA)</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>The question of what life is &#8212; how atoms and molecules become living cells, what differentiates a rock from the lichen on it and a robot from a human being &#8212; has shaped human thought for as long as we have been thinking. For a long time, it was believed that living beings are animated by some mysterious vital force beyond mere matter &#8212; a spark of life, hidden deep within. This view, known as vitalism, crumbled on the anatomy table of Romantic science when the scalpel found\\xa0no mysterious soul-organ super-added by a divine hand. Everything we are, these heretical discoveries intimated, must be housed in the body, must arise from this\\xa0mortal matter, must be the product of physical forces that &#8220;animate the lifeless clay,&#8221; as Mary Shelley (who frequented London&#8217;s science lectures) wrote in <em>Frankenstein</em> &#8212; that far-seeing reckoning with the mystery of life weighed against its materiality. </p>\\n<p>Within a century, just before he sparked the dawn of artificial intelligence, the young Alan Turing was bending his pliant mind around the notion that we are built of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/10/21/turing-natural-wonders/\">&#8220;living bricks set in dead mortar.&#8221;</a></p>\\n<p>Few people have advanced our understanding of these living bricks and their bearing on the mystery of life more profoundly than the marine biologist <strong>Ernest Everett Just</strong> (August 14, 1883&ndash;October 27, 1941).</p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73531\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73531\" height=\"1114\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust.jpg?resize=680%2C1114&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ernest Everett Just (Marine Biological Laboratory Archives)</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Born not long after the development of cell theory began revolutionizing our understanding of life, at a time when the cell was established as the basic biological unit but its inner workings remained an enigma, Just set out to understand how a cell becomes a living organism. Studying a sand dollar during fertilization, he made a landmark discovery of how the egg cell directs its own development &#8212; anathema to prior understanding of the inception of life. </p>\\n<p>A few years before James Baldwin did the same for the same reasons, Just moved to Europe to live and work in self-elected exile freer, though never entirely free, from his homeland&#8217;s prejudices. As a world war was breaking out, he published his magnum opus &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Biology-Cell-Surface-Ernest-Everett/dp/1296505863/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Biology of the Cell Surface</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/809067\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; recounting his revelatory research in uncommonly poetic prose bridging the scientific and the existential. </p>\\n<p>Half a century before the evolutionary biologist Lynn Margulis gave us her Gaia hypothesis of inter-relation, anchored in her view that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/04/19/lynn-margulis-talking-on-the-water/\">&#8220;life is a unitary phenomenon, no matter how we express that fact,&#8221;</a> Just anticipates the <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/12/05/biology-of-wonder-weber/\">the new biology of poetic ecology</a> and writes:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>We feel the beauty of Nature because we are part of Nature and because we know that however much in our separate domains we abstract from the unity of Nature, this unity remains.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This unity holds up at every scale, from the atoms to the stars:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Nature is both continuous and corpuscular. In the former sense, we pass from lower to higher revelations of organization almost insensibly and with scarcely a break. Every form of matter follows upon another. In the latter sense, we recognize breaks in natural states from electron to atom, from atom to molecule, from molecule to compound, and from compounds in association to living matter. But even conceived of as corpuscular, matter, as we know it, is never purely discrete and absolutely independent from the remainder of nature. Whether we study atoms or stars or that form of matter, known as living, always must we reckon with inter-relations. The universe, however much we fragment it, abstract it, ever retains its unity. </p>\\n<p>The egg cell also is a universe. And if we could but know it we would feel in its minute confines the majesty and beauty which match the vast wonder of the world outside of us. In it march events that give us the story of all life from the first moment when somehow out of chaos came life and living.</p></blockquote>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/05/18/ernest-everett-just/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ernesteverettjust3-scaled.jpg?w=1360&#038;ssl=1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Luisa Uribe from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/05/18/ernest-everett-just/\"><em>The Vast Wonder of the World</em></a> &#8212; a picture-book biography of Ernest Everett Just</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Adding to &#8220;the vast wonder of the world,&#8221; rather than subtracting from it, is the knowledge that all this ravishing complexity, all this breathtaking pulsating beauty, is made of the most elementary building blocks:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>The realm of living things being a part of nature is contiguous to the non-living world. Living things have material composition, are made up finally of units, molecules, atoms, and electrons, as surely as any non-living matter. Like all forms in nature they have chemical structure and physical properties, are physico-chemical systems. As such they obey the laws of physics and chemistry. Would one deny this fact, one would thereby deny the possibility of any scientific investigation of living things. No matter what beliefs we entertain, the noblest and purest, concerning life as something apart from physical and chemical phenomena, we can not with the mental equipment which we now possess reach any estimate of living things as apart from the remainder of the physico-chemical world.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Living things, Just observes, are not made of some special stuff but of the commonest chemical elements, so the difference between life and non-life cannot be attributed to matter alone. The difference, he argues, is not one of composition but of organizing principle &#8212; a kind of choreography, orchestrating motion in time. A year before Borges insisted that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/09/19/a-new-refutation-of-time-borges/\">time is the substance we are made of</a>, Just writes:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Living matter has an organization peculiar to itself. Nowhere except in the living world does matter exhibit this organization. Life, even in the simplest animal or plant, so far as we know, never exists apart from it. Resting above and conditioned by non-living matter, life perhaps arose through the chance combination of the compounds which compose it. But who knows? A living thing is not only structure but structure in motion. As static, it reveals the superlative combination of compounds of matter; as a moving event, it presents the most intricate time-pattern in nature. Life is exquisitely a time-thing, like music.</p></blockquote>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/paul-sougy-the-pigeon-1950s-proceeds-benefit-the-nature-conservancy2463644_print?curator=brainpicker\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-69352\" height=\"920\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sougy_pigeon_s6.jpg?resize=680%2C920&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Anatomy of a bird by French artist <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/11/29/paul-sougy/\">Paul Sougy</a>.

Their enormous tubular eyes admit more daylight and have more cells to process photons than the eyes of birds with much sharper daytime vision. While the retinae of most birds are dominated by cones &#8212; photoreceptors tuned to bright light and tasked with color detection &#8212; the retinae of owls contain more than 90% rods, tuned to low light and sensitive to movement: the elements of hunting at night. </p>\\n<p>And yet the most extraordinary aspect of owl vision takes place not in their eyes but in their ears &#8212; theirs is one of the most sensitive auditory systems in nature, connected to one of the most computationally impressive brains.</p>\\n<p>In 1978, neurobiologists Eric Knudsen and Masakazu Konishi set out to illuminate its mysteries. Enlisting the help of an engineer who had worked on NASA&#8217;s <em>Viking</em> spacecraft &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/09/18/the-sirens-of-mars/\">humanity&#8217;s historic reach for Mars</a> &#8212; they sent a loudspeaker circling the head of an owl along a light-rail, traveling at a constant distance from the owl&#8217;s head: part halo and part ring of Saturn. Observing the neural response, they discovered something never before seen in nature &#8212; particular auditory neurons in the owl&#8217;s brain were responding only when a sound was coming from a particular direction: geolocation not by satellite but by sound, doing overground <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/22/cetacean-communication/\">what cetaceans do underwater</a>. </p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/11/21/the-lost-spells-macfarlane-morris/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/owl-closeup.jpg?w=1200&#038;ssl=1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Jackie Morris from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/11/21/the-lost-spells-macfarlane-morris/\"><em>The Lost Spells</em></a></figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Recounting the research in her altogether fascinating book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-Owl-Knows-Science-Enigmatic/dp/0593298888/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>What an Owl Knows: The New Science of the World&#8217;s Most Enigmatic Birds</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1345217975\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>), Jennifer Ackerman writes:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>By comparing the responses to sound by neurons in the cochlea of both ears, the brain builds a kind of multidimensional map of auditory space. This allows owls to fix the location of prey with speed and precision.</p>\\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\\n<p>Animals have brain maps for vision and touch, but these are built from visual images and touch receptors that map onto the brain through direct point-to-point projections. With ears, it’s entirely different. The brain compares information received from each ear about the timing and intensity of a sound and then translates the differences into a unified perception of a single sound issuing from a specific region of space. The resulting auditory map allows owls to “see” the world in two dimensions with their ears.</p></blockquote>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_79702\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/owls-from-the-edinburgh-journal-1835-benefitting-the-nature-conservancy_print?curator=brainpicker\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79702\" height=\"1071\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/edinburghjournal_owls1.jpg?resize=680%2C1071&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Owls from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/02/07/edinburgh-journal-birds/\"><em>The Edinburgh Journal of Natural History and of the Physical Sciences</em></a>, 1830s.

But the owl brain itself remained a frontier of fascination. </p>\\n<p>As other neuroscientists picked up the thread, they discovered that a barn owl&#8217;s brain performs complex mathematical computations to accomplish this spatial specificity, not merely adding and multiplying signals but engaging in a kind of probabilistic statistical calculation known as Bayesian inference. (If there is anything to settle the debate about whether humans have discovered or invented mathematics, here is blazing evidence that this is a fundamental language of nature in constant dialogue with living systems.)</p>\\n<p>Further research into the brain anatomy of owls revealed something even more astonishing: part of their hearing nerve branches off into the optical center of the brain, so that auditory input is processed by the visual system &#8212; literally a way of seeing with sound. </p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/tawny-owl-1893_print?sku=s6-11456629p4a1v1?curator=brainpicker\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-68531\" height=\"729\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/twanyowl1.jpg?resize=680%2C729&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Owl from Lydekker&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/05/29/lydekker-royal-natural-history-owls/\">1893 natural history of owls</a>.

Milan Kundera understood this when he wrote in <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/09/11/milan-kundera-coincidenes/\"><em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em></a> that &#8220;the only truly serious questions are ones that even a child can formulate&#8221; &#8212; questions without answers &#8220;that set the limits of human possibilities, describe the boundaries of human experience.&#8221; I read (and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/01/02/the-snail-with-the-right-heart/\">write</a>) children&#8217;s books to broaden those boundaries, to deepen my questions, to magnify my sense of the possible.</p>\\n<p>After the year&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/12/19/favorite-books-of-2023/\">favorite books for grownups</a>, here are a handful of children&#8217;s books I read and loved and wrote about this year that emanate these qualities of questioning, consolation, of wonder and self-transcendence.</p>\\n<h5>BUNNY &#038; TREE</h5>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bunny-Tree-Balint-Zsako/dp/1592703933/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"cover\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunnyandtree_cover.jpg?resize=768%2C988&#038;ssl=1\" /></a>We spend our lives yearning to be saved &#8212; from harm and heartache, from ourselves, from the inevitability of our oblivion. Religions have taught that a god saves us. Kierkegaard thought that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/09/23/kierkegaard-diary/\">we save ourselves</a>. Baldwin believed that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/04/23/james-baldwin-nothing-personal-4-am/\">we save each other</a>, if we are lucky. Ultimately, we don&#8217;t know, or only think we know, what saves us. But when it happens, we hold on to our saviors with the full force of gratitude and grace.

on the back wall of consciousness through the pinhole of awareness, its aperture narrowed by our selective attention, honed on our hopes and fears. In consequence, the projection we see inside the dark chamber is not raw reality but our hopes and fears magnified &#8212; a rendering not of the world as it is but as we are: frightened, confused, hopeful creatures trying to make sense of the mystery that enfolds us, the mystery that we are. </p>\\n<p>This reality-warping begins as the frights and fantasies of childhood, and evolves into <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/11/23/oliver-sacks-illusions/\">the necessary illusions</a> without which our lives would be unlivable.

The object of human communication is not the exchange of information but the exchange of understanding. If we are lucky enough, if we are attentive enough, communication then becomes a system for the transfer of tenderness. That we have invented so many forms of it &#8212; the language of words, the language of music, the language of flowers &#8212; is a testament to our elemental need for this exchange.</p>\\n<p>A bright and immeasurably tender celebration of that need comes from French author Élise Fontenaille and Spanish artist <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/10/09/the-forest-riccardo-bozzi/\">Violeta Lópiz</a> in their lovely collaboration <a href=\"https://enchantedlion.com/all-books/at-the-drop-of-a-cat\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>At the Drop of a Cat</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1334895182\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://enchantedlion.com/all-books/at-the-drop-of-a-cat\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81329\" height=\"939\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat1.jpg?resize=680%2C939&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a></p>\\n<p>We meet a six-year-old boy just learning to read and write in his grandfather Luis&#8217;s house &#8212; a house Luis has built with his own hands, surrounded by a garden full of artichokes the size of heads and green beans climbing into the sky &#8212; a garden that &#8220;feels like a whole other world.&#8221;</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://enchantedlion.com/all-books/at-the-drop-of-a-cat\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81328\" height=\"939\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat2.jpg?resize=680%2C939&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://enchantedlion.com/all-books/at-the-drop-of-a-cat\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81333\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat21.jpg?resize=680%2C460&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a></p>\\n<p>Through the little boy&#8217;s unjudging eyes, in illustrations as textured and layered as a life well lived, a loving portrait of Luis emerges &#8212; his green thumb and the way he &#8220;speaks bird language,&#8221; his gifts for painting and cooking, his many tattoos, his thick Spanish accent and his charming misuse of idioms: He calls his grandson &#8220;the apple of his pie&#8221; and loves the expression &#8220;at the drop of a cat,&#8221; of which the little boy is so fond that he continues using it in school despite his teacher&#8217;s correction. </p>\\n<p>As the portrait unfolds, we realize that Luis misuses idioms because he has only ever heard them spoken, in a foreign tongue: When he was a little boy himself, having spent his childhood working in the fields, he fled war-torn Spain and &#8220;crossed mountains and hills and the countryside until he got to France.&#8221; He never went to school, never learned to write. Instead, he developed his own language of belonging &#8212; a living lexicon for feeling at home in the living world.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://enchantedlion.com/all-books/at-the-drop-of-a-cat\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81336\" height=\"950\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat7.jpg?resize=680%2C950&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a></p>\\n<p>And that is how Luis communicates with his grandson &#8212;

as Freud insisted that the more we understand human psychology, the more we can &#8220;deduce a formula for an indirect method of eliminating war.&#8221; In her timeless treatise on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/03/06/is-peace-possible-kathleen-lonsdale/\">the building blocks of peace</a>, the pioneering crystallographer and peace activist Kathleen Lonsdale located that formula in the moral education of our young &#8212;

not even in the safest of circumstances, not even with the sanest of her engineer&#8217;s reasoning. These scars that war leaves on the souls of children are a living testament to the great cellist Pablo Casals&#8217;s insistence that our primary motive force for ending violence should be <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/03/10/pablo-casals-joys-and-sorrows-jfk/\">&#8220;to make this world worthy of its children.&#8221;</a></p>\\n<p>How children survive the unsurvivable, how they keep the light inside aflame, is what Ukrainian artist <strong>Oleksandr Shatokhin</strong> explores in his stirring wordless story <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Yellow-Butterfly-Ukraine-Oleksandr-Shatokhin/dp/1636550649/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Yellow Butterfly</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/1338198319\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Yellow-Butterfly-Ukraine-Oleksandr-Shatokhin/dp/1636550649/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81110\" height=\"451\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/yellowbutterfly21.jpg?resize=680%2C451&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a></p>\\n<p>We enter a world of darkness and barbed wire, a world of which a frightened little girl is trying to make sense. </p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Yellow-Butterfly-Ukraine-Oleksandr-Shatokhin/dp/1636550649/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81115\" height=\"484\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/yellowbutterfly1.jpg?resize=680%2C484&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a></p>\\n<p>Running in terror from the bombs raining down upon her, she suddenly encounters a bright yellow butterfly. </p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Yellow-Butterfly-Ukraine-Oleksandr-Shatokhin/dp/1636550649/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81109\" height=\"467\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/yellowbutterfly22.jpg?resize=680%2C467&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a></p>\\n<p>As she goes on walking alongside the barbed wire &#8212;

Someday it will swallow every atom that ever touched us and every datum we ever produced, swallow Euclid’s postulates and the <em>Goldberg Variations</em>, calculus and <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.</p>\\n<p>When black holes first emerged from the mathematics of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/07/11/stephon-alexander-rebecca-elson-explaining-relativity/\">relativity</a>, Einstein himself wavered on whether or not they could be real &#8212; he struggled to imagine that nature could produce so menacing a thing, that spacetime could bend to such a monstrous extreme. And then it took us a mere century to hear with our <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/04/25/black-hole-blues-janna-levin-joseph-weber/\">immense prosthetic ear</a> the sound of two black holes colliding to churn a gravitational wave, then to see with our telescopic eye <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwE_g1mDMnN/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&#038;igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an actual black hole</a> in the cosmic wild. Here looms living proof of Richard Feynman&#8217;s insistence that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/07/19/richard-feynman-science-morality-poem/\">&#8220;the imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man.&#8221;</a></p>\\n<p>With their cosmic drama and their dazzling science at the edge of the possible, black holes beckon the human imagination with myriad metaphors for our existential perplexities. One of them comes alive in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Black-Hole-Molly-Webster/dp/0593464753/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Little Black Hole</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/1378487994\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>), by<br />\\n<em>Radiolab</em> producer <strong>Molly Webster</strong> and artist <strong>Alex Willmore</strong> &#8212; an uncommon meditation on how to live with the austere existential loneliness of knowing that everything and everyone we cherish can be taken away from us and is ultimately destined for oblivion, how to live with the looming loss that is the price of being fully alive. </p>\\n<p>The story&#8217;s central conceit draws on Stephen Hawking&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/11/19/stephen-hawking-black-hole-information-paradox-explained/\">black hole information paradox</a> &#8212; the combined intimation of relativity and quantum field theory that, even though not even light can escape from a black hole, bits of information can transcend its immense gravitational pull and break free in the form of what is known as Hawking radiation. </p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Black-Hole-Molly-Webster/dp/0593464753/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-80702\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole7.jpg?resize=680%2C338&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a></p>\\n<p>Tucked into the lyrical opening lines is a subtle vulpine allusion to <em>The Little Prince</em>, that most poetic of cosmic tales:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>There once was a little black hole who loved everything in the universe.</p>\\n<p>The stars. The planets. The space rocks and the space fox. Even the flying astronauts.</p>\\n<p>The little black hole loved her friends.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>One day, the little black hole befriends a star, but just as they are delighting in building a cosmic castle together, the star vanishes, her light nowhere to be seen. </p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Black-Hole-Molly-Webster/dp/0593464753/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-80704\" height=\"521\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole2.jpg?resize=680%2C521&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a></p>\\n<p>Next, a comet swings by, but just as the little black hole grows giddy for a new friendship, the comet crumbles to cosmic dust and disappears. </p>\\n<p>So they come and they go, the planets and the asteroids, the fox and the astronauts, each new friend taken away as soon as they get close, leaving the little black hole baffled and bereaved. </p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Black-Hole-Molly-Webster/dp/0593464753/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-80703\" height=\"573\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole6.jpg?resize=680%2C573&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Black-Hole-Molly-Webster/dp/0593464753/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-80707\" height=\"636\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole3.jpg?resize=680%2C636&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a></p>\\n<p>Confused and disconsolate, the little black hole comes upon a big black hole replete with <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/07/29/excellent-advice-for-living-kevin-kelly/\">an elder&#8217;s wisdom</a>, who illuminates the fundamental fact that to be a black hole means to swallow and annihilate anything and anyone who comes near. </p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Black-Hole-Molly-Webster/dp/0593464753/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-80706\" height=\"517\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole4.jpg?resize=680%2C517&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a></p>\\n<p>And yet bits of information can escape from the belly of the black hole, bubbling back up as remnants of what was consumed. Out of Hawking&#8217;s legacy arises the story&#8217;s central metaphor for how to live with loss: Because, in poet Meghan O&#8217;Rourke&#8217;s lovely words, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/06/09/meghan-o-rourke-the-long-goodbye/\">&#8220;the people we most love do become a physical part of us, ingrained in our synapses, in the pathways where memories are created,&#8221;</a> we can always bring them back up to the surface of our consciousness with the twin levers of memory and imagination. </p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Black-Hole-Molly-Webster/dp/0593464753/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-80705\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/littleblackhole5.jpg?resize=680%2C338&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a></p>\\n<p>This might seem like cold consolation for the infernal heat of loss. And yet it is no small gift that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/08/22/victor-johnston-consciousness/\">a cold cosmos kindled the warm glow of consciousness</a> &#8212; this radiant faculty that makes it possible to love and to suffer, to imagine and to remember; this wonder that &#8212; like music, like love &#8212; didn&#8217;t have to exist. </p>\\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).

With these human minds, arising from these material bodies, we keep trying to find heaven &#8212; to make heaven &#8212; in our myths and our mundanities, right here in the place where we are: in this beautiful and troubled world.

And the natural place to embark upon such an inquiry &#8212; should we discard the notion of heaven entirely? &#8212; seemed to be the culture that had given us both our word for paradise and some of our most soulful images of it.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>In Jerusalem, he walks through the Damascus Gate to find himself in &#8220;something as irreducible as life.&#8221; He visits the Himalayas and North Korea. As he travels, he is reminded of the seventeen years he spent at a Benedictine monastery in the mountains of California &#8212; an experience that forever imprinted him with the voice of inner stillness and the awareness that presence is the fundamental portal to the sacred:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Days, sometimes weeks, in the silence had given me a taste of what lies on the far side of our thoughts. Who we become &#8212; cease to become &#8212; when we put all ideas and theories behind us. I went often through pages of Thomas Merton there, but they seemed to belong to the cacophony below the stillness; the golden pampas grass in front of me, the dry hills beyond, the fleecy clouds stealing up the hillside &#8212; not what I thought about them &#8212; were the truth.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>He arrives at the oceanic idyll of Sri Lanka in the lull of ceasefire after twenty years of violent fighting between the separatists and the government, not long after a deadly tsunami devastated the island. Over and over, he finds himself contemplating the interplay of beauty and brutality, in nature and human nature, reading the solution to the riddle in the still stone countenances of the statues in a local temple:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>The Buddhas&#8230; stared at me impassively. Onto the quiet faces in the sun I could project anything I needed. Our one task is to make friends with reality, I could imagine them whispering &#8212; which is to say, with impermanence and suffering and death; the unrest you feel will always have more to do with you than with what’s around you. In one celebrated story, the Buddha had come upon a group of picnickers who were enraged because they’d just been robbed. “Which,” he’d famously asked, “is more important? To find the robbers or to find yourself?”</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/02/04/pico-iyer-the-half-known-life/\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h5>THE TRANSCENDENT BRAIN</h5>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/03/14/the-transcendent-brain-alan-lightman/\"><img class=\"cover\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/transcendentbrain_lightman.jpg\" /></a>“That is happiness,&#8221; Willa Cather <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/08/26/willa-cather-my-antonia-happiness/\">wrote</a>, &#8220;to be dissolved into something complete and great.&#8221; We have many names for that dissolution, all revolving around some sense of spirituality and they all involving what Iris Murdoch so splendidly termed <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/10/21/iris-murdoch-unselfing/\">&#8220;unselfing&#8221;</a> &#8212; experiences, most often furnished by art, music, and nature, that allow us to &#8220;pierce the veil of selfish consciousness and join the world as it really is.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>At the heart of both our spirituality and our science lies this eternal yearning to know the world as it really is &#8212; a yearning with an infinite vector, pointing always just past the horizon of our knowledge, anchored always in the most elemental nature of the human animal: our curiosity, our restlessness, our hunger for truth and transcendence. </p>\\n<p>And yet the reflex of selfing, which stands so often between us and elemental truth, between us and transcendence, is hard-wired in our physiology &#8212; our entire experience of reality is lensed through our individual consciousness, housed in the brain and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/12/24/feeling-knowing-damasio/\">tendrilled through the body</a>.

From the prescient atomic materialism of Lucretius to Maxwell&#8217;s equations, from the poems of Emily Dickinson to the synchronized firing of neurons in recognizing a loved one&#8217;s face, from the Hindu concept of <em>darshan</em> &#8212; the beholding of a deity or sacred object &#8212; to the cosmic wonders we have beheld through the <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/11/universe-in-verse-animated-hubble/\">&#8220;oracle eye&#8221;</a> of our majestic space telescopes, he argues that spiritual experiences &#8220;are as natural as hunger or love or desire, given a brain of sufficient complexity.&#8221; Radiating from the millennia-wide inquiry is a revelation about how mere atoms and molecules can give rise to the very persuasive experience of a self, of a soul, of something that feels so vast and complex and magnificently irreducible to matter. </p>\\n<p>He writes:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I’m a scientist and have always had a scientific view of the world &#8212; by which I mean that the universe is made of material stuff, and only material stuff, and that stuff is governed by a small number of fundamental laws. Every phenomenon has a cause, which originates in the physical universe. I’m a materialist. Not in the sense of seeking happiness in cars and nice clothes, but in the literal sense of the word: the belief that everything is made out of atoms and molecules, and nothing more. Yet, I have transcendent experiences. I <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/01/15/alan-lightman-accidental-universe-science-spirituality/\">communed with two ospreys that summer in Maine</a>. I have feelings of being part of things larger than myself.

I have a sense of beauty. I have experiences of awe. And I’ve had <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/02/10/alan-lightman-a-sense-of-the-mysterious-1/\">transporting creative moments</a>.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>The aggregate of these very different types of experiences, echoes of which reverberate through every human life, is what he terms &#8220;spirituality&#8221; &#8212; a notion he nests inside the paradox of materiality and irreducibility:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I believe that the spiritual experiences we have can arise from atoms and molecules. At the same time, some of these experiences, and certainly their very personal and subjective nature, cannot be fully understood in terms of atoms and molecules. I believe in the laws of chemistry and biology and physics &#8212; in fact, as a scientist I much admire those laws &#8212; but I don’t think they capture, or can capture, the first-person experience of making eye contact with wild animals and similar transcendent moments. Some human experiences are simply not reducible to zeros and ones.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Therein lies the paradox &#8212; given that &#8220;all mental sensations are rooted in the material neurons of the nervous system and the electrical and chemical interactions between them,&#8221; how can this inescapable materiality wing us with such feelings of spirituality?</p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_79977\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-by-francisco-de-holanda-from-images-of-the-ages-of-the-world-1573_framed-print?curator=brainpicker\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79977\" height=\"987\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/FranciscoDeHolanda11.jpg?resize=680%2C987&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/03/08/francisco-de-holanda/\">Francisco de Holanda</a>, 1573.

It comes when we least expect it, like a murmuration of starlings across the evening sky. It stays for as long as we are able to stay openhearted to the tender transience of life. Anaïs Nin knew this when she contemplated <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/11/12/anais-nin-mirages-joy/\">its elusive nature</a>, and Beethoven knew it when he spent half a lifetime <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/05/07/ode-to-joy-flashmob/\">capturing it in an ode</a>.</p>\\n<p>The secret pulse-beat of joy is what <strong>Jean-François Beauchemin</strong> explores in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Archives-Joy-Reflections-Animals-Nature/dp/1771649321/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Archives of Joy: Reflections on Animals and the Nature of Being</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/1337145113\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; an invitation to &#8220;a certain, forgotten way of seeing the world&#8221; and an exultation at &#8220;earthly life, with its duration so short it obliges us to surpass ourselves.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>In a passage Walt Whitman could have composed a century and a half ago, Beauchemin introduces himself:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I am simply a man who is always moved and amazed by the brevity of everything, and who strives to at least balance this brevity a little by way of the counterweights within my reach, be it joy, for instance, or otherwise the seeking of beauty.</p></blockquote>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/05/04/the-gold-leaf-hall-forsythe/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/thegoldleaf9.jpg?w=1200&#038;ssl=1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Matthew Forsythe from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/05/04/the-gold-leaf-hall-forsythe/\"><em>The Gold Leaf</em></a></figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Beauchemin begins his archive of joy with an encounter:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Every other day since the start of summer, an old deer with a grizzled gray snout has been wandering into my garden to dream away some of what little time he has left. The light around him pivots by a few degrees, arranging its photons as if to ready him for his passing into the beyond. As his body escapes him a little more each day, I think that he’s slowly coming around to a more abstract and somehow purer way of seeing the world. It’s as if his subconscious has fallen out of sync with him and the intricacies and intensity of his life in the forest. From the look in his eye, and the story of sorts that it seems to tell, one remarkably real thing emerges: joy. I know that joy.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>It is an old joy he finds there, and an old touchstone at the boundary of the natural world and the numinous:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I have no theory to explain the sense of closeness and connection I have felt to deer&#8230; Perhaps I am so drawn to them because they defy all explanation. I am continually moved by these timid beings, steeped in wary, woodsy contemplation, graced with a playful spring in their step and a synchrony of memory. I am quite sure that their mind’s eye holds an everlasting, airy daydream of a big red sun with people whirling about in their finest new clothes and a cascade of colors, just like a Marc Chagall painting. Alas, I only have intermittent access to this metaphorical world. I try my best to stay awhile, but all I can manage are fleeting moments. The images in my memory and imagination are not terribly compatible with those I think I see swirling in the gaze of my elusive visitors. The wood-wormed doors, half-moored rowboats, and secret infernos of my mind will always be foreign to the concerns of these beautiful animals. Still, they and I walk in step, and at night we lift our gaze to the same stars.</p></blockquote>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_75738\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-by-virginia-frances-sterrett-from-old-french-fairy-tales-1920_print?curator=brainpicker\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Art by Virginia Frances Sterrett, Old French Fairy Tales, 1920\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75738\" height=\"883\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett2.jpg?resize=680%2C883&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Century-old art by the adolescent <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/27/virginia-frances-sterrett-old-french-fairy-tales/\">Virginia Frances Sterrett</a>.

And yet where would the world be if each generation didn&#8217;t plank its crossing with the life-tested wisdom of its elders?

Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves.</p>\\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\\n<p>Forgiveness is accepting the apology you will never get.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Inverting the equation and echoing <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/10/24/repentance-repair-ruttenberg/\">Maimonedes&#8217;s wisdom on repentance and repair</a>, he maps the noblest path to seeking forgiveness when you yourself have erred:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>How to apologize: quickly, specifically, sincerely. Don’t ruin an apology with an excuse.</p>\\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\\n<p>A proper apology consists of conveying the 3 Rs: regret (genuine empathy with the other) responsibility (not blaming someone else) and remedy (your willingness to fix it).</p></blockquote>\\n<p>In consonance with George Saunders&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/04/28/george-saunders-on-kindness-animated/\">moving reflection on his greatest regret</a>, Kelly urges:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Whenever you have a choice between being right or being kind be kind. No exceptions. Don’t confuse kindness with weakness.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>In a kindred sentiment that would have pleased Simone Weil, who exhorts us across the epochs to <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/04/07/simone-weil-notebooks/\">&#8220;never react to an evil in such a way as to augment it,&#8221;</a> he adds:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Anger is not the proper response to anger.

Each day, we live with the puzzlement of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/10/07/rebecca-goldstein-personal-identity/\">what makes us and our childhood self the &#8220;same&#8221; person</a>, even though most of our cells and our dreams have been replaced. Each day, we find ourselves restless miniatures of a vast universe we are only just beginning to fathom. </p>\\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Notes-Complexity-Scientific-Connection-Consciousness/dp/1954118252/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Notes on Complexity: A Scientific Theory of Connection, Consciousness, and Being</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/1378021952\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>), the Buddhist scientist <strong>Neil Theise</strong> endeavors to bridge the mystery out there with the mystery of us, bringing together our three primary instruments of investigating reality &#8212; empirical science (with a focus on complexity theory), philosophy (with a focus on Western idealism), and metaphysics (with a focus on Buddhism, Vedanta, Kabbalah, and Saivism) &#8212; to paint a picture of the universe and all of its minutest parts &#8220;as nothing but a vast, self-organizing, complex system, the emergent properties of which are&#8230; everything.&#8221;</p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/10/24/we-are-starlings/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wearestarlings0.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art Marc Martin by from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/10/24/we-are-starlings/\"><em>We Are Starlings</em></a></figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Theise defines the core scientific premise of his inquiry:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Complexity theory is the study of how complex systems manifest in the world&#8230; Complexity in this context refers to a class of patterns of interactions: open-ended, evolving, unpredictable, yet adaptive and self-sustaining&#8230; how life self-organizes from the substance of our universe, from interactions within the quantum foam to the formation of atoms and molecules, cells, human beings, social structures, ecosystems, and beyond.</p>\\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\\n<p>Neither we nor our universe is machinelike. A machine doesn’t have the option to change its behavior if its environment changes or becomes overwhelming. Complex systems, including human bodies and human societies, can change their behaviors in the face of the unpredictable. That creativity is the essence of complexity.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>A century after Schrödinger made his haunting assertion that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/23/schrodinger-mind-and-matter/\">&#8220;the over-all number of minds is just one,&#8221;</a> Theise considers the ultimate reward of this lens on reality:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Complexity theory can foster an invaluable flexibility of perspectives and awaken us to our true, deep intimacy with the larger whole, so that we might return to what we once had: our birthright of being one with all.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/08/27/notes-on-complexity-neil-theise/\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h5>THE ASKING</h5>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/10/17/to-be-a-person-jane-hirshfield/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"cover\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/janehirshfield_theasking.jpg?resize=768%2C1159&#038;ssl=1\" /></a>For half a century, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/jane-hirshfield/\">Jane Hirshfield</a> has been slaking the world&#8217;s soul on poems of perspective and consolation, fusing her Buddhist training, her passion for science, and her tenderness for all things living.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Asking-New-Selected-Poems/dp/0593535952/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Asking</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://worldcat.org/title/1350965665\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) collects some of her best work, including such treasures as <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/05/14/jane-hirshfield-optimism-kelli-anderson-animation/\">&#8220;Optimism,&#8221;</a> <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/03/15/today-another-universe-jane-hirshfield-ledger-jasmine/\">&#8220;Today, Another Universe,&#8221;</a> <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/10/23/the-weighing-jane-hirshfield/\">&#8220;The Weighing,&#8221;</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/10/17/to-be-a-person-jane-hirshfield/\">&#8220;To Be a Person&#8221;</a> &#8212; poems that achieve the most difficult and paradoxical of triumphs for a work of art: to remind us who and what we are, while at the same time furnishing what Iris Murdoch called <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/10/21/iris-murdoch-unselfing/\">&#8220;an occasion for unselfing.&#8221;</a></p>\\n<blockquote><p><strong>HOPE AND LOVE</strong><br />\\n<em>by Jane Hirshfield</em></p>\\n<p>All winter<br />\\nthe blue heron<br />\\nslept among the horses.<br />\\nI do not know<br />\\nthe custom of herons,<br />\\ndo not know<br />\\nif the solitary habit<br />\\nis their way,<br />\\nor if he listened for<br />\\nsome missing one &#8212;<br />\\nnot knowing even<br />\\nthat was what he did &#8212;<br />\\nin the blowing<br />\\nsounds in the dark,<br />\\nI know that<br />\\nhope is the hardest<br />\\nlove we carry.<br />\\nHe slept<br />\\nwith his long neck<br />\\nfolded, like a letter<br />\\nput away.</p></blockquote>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/01/14/the-blue-hour-isabelle-simler/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81573\" height=\"898\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/isabellesimler_heron.jpg?resize=680%2C898&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Isabelle Simler from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/01/14/the-blue-hour-isabelle-simler/\"><em>The Blue Hour</em></a></figcaption></figure>\\n<h5>THE EXPERIENCE MACHINE</h5>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/06/20/the-experience-machine-andy-clark/\"><img class=\"cover\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/theexperiencemachine_andyclark.jpg?resize=768%2C1159&#038;ssl=1\" /></a>Attention is less a lens on the world than a mirror for the mind. &#8220;My experience is what I agree to attend to,&#8221; William James wrote in his <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/03/25/william-james-attention/\">foundational treatise on attention</a> in the final years of the nineteenth century. In the epoch since, we have discovered just what an <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/08/12/on-looking-eleven-walks-with-expert-eyes/\">&#8220;intentional, unapologetic discriminator&#8221;</a> attention is, just how much <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/05/10/iain-mcgilchrist-the-matter-with-things/\">it shapes our entire experience of reality</a>. But we are only just beginning to discover that, far from a passive observer of the outside world, our attention is an active creator of it as the brain makes constant conscious and unconscious predictions of what it expects to find when it looks, then finds just that; we are only beginning to understand how right Thoreau was when, in James&#8217;s epoch, he observed that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/02/07/thoreau-knowing-seeing/\">&#8220;we hear and apprehend only what we already half know.&#8221;</a></p>\\n<p>That is what cognitive philosopher <strong>Andy Clark</strong> explores in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Experience-Machine-Minds-Predict-Reality/dp/1524748455/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Experience Machine: How Our Minds Predict and Shape Reality</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/1334720971\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; an illuminating investigation of the human brain as a prediction machine that evolved to render reality as a composite of sensory input and prior expectation, replete with implications for neuroscience, psychology, medicine, mental health, neurodiversity, the relationship between the body and the self, and the way we live our lives. </p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_80417\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80417\" height=\"458\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/renemagritte_thefalsemirror.jpg?resize=680%2C458&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">René Magritte. <em>The False Mirror</em>. 1929. (Museum of Modern Art.)</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Clark writes:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Contrary to the standard belief that our senses are a kind of passive window onto the world, what is emerging is a picture of an ever-active brain that is always striving to predict what the world might currently have to offer. Those predictions then structure and shape the whole of human experience, from the way we interpret a person’s facial expression, to our feelings of pain, to our plans for an outing to the cinema. </p>\\n<p>Nothing we do or experience &#8212; if the theory is on track &#8212; is untouched by our own expectations. Instead, there is a constant give-and-take in which what we experience reflects not just what the world is currently telling us, but what we &#8212; consciously or nonconsciously &#8212; were expecting it to be telling us. One consequence of this is that we are never simply seeing what’s “really there,” stripped bare of our own anticipations or insulated from our own past experiences. Instead, all human experience is part phantom &#8212; the product of deep-set predictions.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Because these predictions are informed by our past experience, reality is not how the present self parses the world but how the Russian nesting doll of selves we carry &#8212; all the people we have ever been, with all the experiences we have ever had &#8212; constructs the world before its eyes. Our sensorium is a simulation we ourselves are constantly running. Clark traces this predictive process as it unfolds at the meeting point of stimulus and expectation:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Incoming sensory signals help correct errors in prediction, but the predictions are in the driver’s seat now. This means that what we perceive today is deeply rooted in what we experienced yesterday, and all the days before that. Every aspect of our daily experience comes to us filtered by hidden webs of prediction &#8212; the brain’s best expectations rooted in our own past histories.</p>\\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\\n<p>When the brain strongly predicts a certain sight, a sound, or a feeling, that prediction plays a role in shaping what we seem to see, hear, or feel. </p>\\n<p>Emotion, mood, and even planning are all based in predictions too. Depression, anxiety, and fatigue all reflect alterations to the hidden predictions that shape our experience. Alter those predictions (for example, by “reframing” a situation using different words) and our experience itself alters.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>At the heart of this equivalence is the recognition that changing our expectations changes our experience &#8212; not in a New Age way, but in a neurocognitive way. With an eye to the opportunity to &#8220;hack our own predictive minds,&#8221; which Bruce Lee intuited in his insistence that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/08/01/bruce-lee-notebook/\">&#8220;you will never get any more out of life than you expect,&#8221;</a> Clark observes:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Since experience is always shaped by our own expectations, there is an opportunity to improve our lives by altering some of those expectations, and the confidence with which they are held.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/06/20/the-experience-machine-andy-clark/\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h5>WHAT LOOKS LIKE BRAVERY</h5>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-Looks-Like-Bravery-Journey/dp/1501158503/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"cover\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bravery_braitman.jpg?w=680&#038;ssl=1\" /></a>“Fearlessness is what love seeks,&#8221; Hannah Arendt wrote in her timeless meditation on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/02/25/love-and-saint-augustine-hannah-arendt/\">love and how to live with the fundamental fear of loss</a>. &#8220;Such fearlessness exists only in the complete calm that can no longer be shaken by events expected of the future… Hence the only valid tense is the present, the Now.”</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/06/10/animal-madness-laurel-braitman/\">Laurel Braitman</a> was three when she was violently thrust into a perpetual Now: Her forty-one-year-old father was diagnosed with a rare, aggressive bone cancer and given a blink of time to live. The eccentric idyll of her family home &#8212; an avocado ranch populated by chickens, two donkeys, &#8220;four aloof merino sheep,&#8221; and a mean-spirited peacock &#8212; was suddenly haunted by the sense that each day could be the last. And yet her father &#8212; an accomplished surgeon himself, and a man with unabashed disdain for the impossible &#8212; managed to launch so fierce a war on his mortality, shedding more and more of his body in experimental surgeries to earn more time with his family, that he lived to see Laurel head to college, lovingly nourishing her dream of becoming a writer, a dream anchored in her longing &#8220;to make up better endings than the ones we’d been given.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Along the way, he tried to instill in her his ethos of invincibility &#8212; at first empowering as she learns to fix carburetors, outfish all the fishermen, and do field work in Alaska and the Amazon, but eventually disabling as she wades into the waters of that most vincible of human endeavors: love. </p>\\n<p>A cascade of further losses &#8212; her mother&#8217;s death, the wildfire that burns the avocado ranch to the ground &#8212; teaches her what her father, with his larger-than-life bid for bravery, never dared admit: that acknowledging suffering is the fulcrum of strength, that fragility is the other face of resilience, and that our breaking points are also portals of possibility.</p>\\n<p>She tells the story of those difficult, transformative learnings in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-Looks-Like-Bravery-Journey/dp/1501158503/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>What Looks Like Bravery</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/1334720971\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; a book about hope (&#8220;a trickster that transforms itself all the time, expanding to fill the space it’s given&#8221;), about loss, how it stays with us and how we go on (&#8220;just like when you close the door to a room and walk into another, the one you leave doesn’t stop existing.

And so it must be: “A self that goes on changing is a self that goes on living,” Virginia Woolf wrote, for she understood that the finest souls <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/09/12/virginia-woolf-soul/\">&#8220;are always the supplest.&#8221;</a> </p>\\n<p>The exquisite challenge of becoming oneself but remaining supple is at the center of every life, but it is amplified in the creative life &#8212; there is no greater tragedy for an artist than to stagnate and stiffen into a fixity, a template of oneself that ceases to create and instead caters to a self-myth. &#8220;Are we going to ossify,&#8221; the young Emily Dickinson <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/12/10/emily-dickinson-love-letters-susan-gilbert/\">wrote rhetorically to her great love and muse</a> at the outset of an uncommonly creative life, throughout which she refused to ossify, as a person and as an artist.</p>\\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sweat-History-Exercise-Bill-Hayes/dp/1620402289/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Sweat</em></strong></a> &#8212; his <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/05/10/sweat-bill-hayes/\">magnificent history of exercise as a lens on the body and the soul</a> &#8212; Bill Hayes offers an antidote to ossifying rooted in the parallels between creative practice and athletic training.</p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73778\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/06/26/alice-austen/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73778\" height=\"509\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/aliceausten11.jpg?resize=680%2C509&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Group Apparatus</em> by <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/06/26/alice-austen/\">Alice Austen</a>, 1893.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Drawing an analogy between the science of exercise and his own art &#8212; writing &#8212; he considers the six principles that sustain long-term personal fitness.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>The Principle of Specificity</strong> is the idea that &#8220;what you train for is what you get&#8221; &#8212; if your goal is endurance, train for endurance; if your goal is strength, train for strength; if you aim to make your prose more musical, train your mind&#8217;s ear on musical writing; if you want to write better observations, train to make better observations. &#8220;Be specific in your work goals as much as in your workouts,&#8221; Hayes writes.</li>\\n<li><strong>The Overload Principle</strong> requires that you &#8220;train a part of the body above the level to which it is accustomed&#8221; &#8212; it is the practice of pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone and trying new things. Hayes calls its equivalent in the mind &#8220;creative cross-training.&#8221; Rilke understood this: &#8220;People are drawn to the easy and to the easiest side of the easy,&#8221; he <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/06/29/rilke-letters-to-a-young-poet-macy-barrows/\">wrote in contemplating creativity</a>. &#8220;But it is clear that we must hold ourselves to the difficult.&#8221;</li>\\n<li><strong>The Principle of Progression</strong> arises out of the Overload Principle, demanding that you move on as soon as you have mastered a new task. Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe knew this. &#8220;Making your unknown known is the important thing,&#8221; she wrote in <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/12/08/georgia-okeeffe-sherwood-anderson-letters/\">her advice on being an artist</a>, &#8220;and keeping the unknown always beyond you.&#8221;</li>\\n<li><strong>The Principle of Accommodation</strong> takes effect in the absence of the Progression Principle: Without challenge, the body &#8212; or the spirit &#8212; settles into stagnation or, worse, complacency. David Bowie urged against this reflex toward comfort and homeostasis: &#8220;Always go a little further into the water than you feel you’re capable of being in,&#8221; he <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/11/24/david-bowie-creativity-advice/\">advised artists</a>. &#8220;Go a little bit out of your depth, and when you don’t feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting.&#8221;</li>\\n<li><strong>The Principle of Reversibility</strong> is an admonition against the trap of accommodation &#8212; when you cease challenging yourself, the arc of your progress bends backward, undoing your gains. It almost doesn&#8217;t matter what you do to keep your system from falling out of shape &#8212; it need not be your primary workout, or your primary work. Virginia Woolf felt that her informal diary writing <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/09/04/famous-writers-on-keeping-a-diary/\">&#8220;loosens the ligaments&#8221;</a> for her formal literary writing. &#8220;One must do something, anything, to keep the creative and intellectual motors running,&#8221; Hayes writes.</li>\\n<li><strong>The Principle of Rest</strong> may then seem like a paradox &#8212; but it is the final and in a sense the most foundational tenet of any sustained practice. Anyone who has suffered the aches and injuries of overtraining, anyone who has suffered the spiritual hollowing of burnout, knows the cost of not taking time to recover from exertion, to replenish the body&#8217;s energy and the soul&#8217;s store of creative vitality. &#8220;Just as the body needs time to rest,&#8221; writes Hayes, whose superb book <em>The Anatomist</em> demanded of him a three-year recovery, &#8220;so does an essay, story, chapter, poem, or especially, a book.&#8221;</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Couple with Zadie Smith on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/03/08/zadie-smith-dance-lessons-for-writers/\">what writers can learn from dancers</a>, then revisit some excellent advice on writing (applicable to all creative work) from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/02/08/james-baldwin-advice-on-writing/\">James Baldwin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/08/22/albert-camus-writing/\">Albert Camus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/09/20/octavia-butler-advice-on-writing/\">Octavia Butler</a>, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/08/28/rachel-carson-house-of-life-writing-loneliness/\">Rachel Carson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/06/24/rebecca-solnit-writing-gardening/\">Rebecca Solnit</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/10/12/mary-oliver-upstream-creativity-power-time/\">Mary Oliver</a>.</p>\\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).

Lynn Margulis captured this in ecological and evolutionary terms when she observed that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/04/19/lynn-margulis-talking-on-the-water/\">&#8220;life is a unitary phenomenon, no matter how we express that fact.&#8221;</a> Dr. King captured the sociological equivalent in his insistence that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/03/18/martin-luther-king-letter-from-birmingham-city-jail/\">&#8220;we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality.&#8221;</a> Whitman captured its most elemental and most existential dimensions in that immortal line: <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/10/19/lia-halloran-walt-whitman-universe-in-verse/\">“Every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.”</a></p>\\n<p>When we fail to see the connections between things, we fail to anticipate the consequences of any one thing. A century before we began slaying entire ecosystems with pesticides meant to eradicate individual species, before we began tinkering with individual genes in the complex cathedral of the genome, the naturalist John Muir exulted that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/05/10/john-muir-nature-writings/\">&#8220;when we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe&#8221;</a> &#8212; an exultation that now reads as an admonition.</p>\\n<p>How to unblind ourselves to this cosmos of connection and its attendant forcefield of consequence is what Jenn Shapland explores in her essay collection <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thin-Skin-Essays-Jenn-Shapland/dp/0593317459/?tag=braipick-20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Thin Skin</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1349288032\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; &#8220;a corporeal account of how thin the membrane is between each of us and one another, between each of us and the world outside,&#8221; fomented by the medical reality of her epidermis missing a layer: a diagnosis of literally thin skin.</p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_69014\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/the-universe-in-verse/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69014\" height=\"680\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lia_1200.jpg?resize=680%2C680&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Lia Halloran for <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/the-universe-in-verse/\"><em>The Universe in Verse</em></a>.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>With an eye to the embodied metaphor of her condition, Shapland writes:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>There is no “outside”&#8230; The world is a part of our cellular makeup&#8230; we impact it with every tiny choice we make.</p>\\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\\n<p>I began to see what I now think of as literalized metaphors for my entanglement, my complicity, all over my life: in my dermatological diagnosis of “thin skin,” in my friends’ having babies as the world burned, in the crystals cropping up everywhere to heal us of something, in my own sense of vulnerability and my desire to feel safe. I began to question the idea of myself as a being in need of protection, indeed as something that could be protected. Nothing can protect us&#8230; It struck me as I wrote that I was utterly vulnerable to every other person, every other creature on Earth, and they were also vulnerable to me&#8230; I began to seek other ways of understanding the self that might be more useful than this shivering, weak thing we must shore up against the world.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>And yet out of that singular vulnerability comes a singular strength &#8212; liberated from the standard boundaries between self and world, which serve as culture&#8217;s safety valve constricting what is possible and permissible, one is free to imagine &#8220;alternatives to our limited narratives about family, love, labor, longing, pleasure, safety, and legacy.&#8221; A century after D.H. Lawrence reverenced <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/10/13/d-h-lawrence-brute-force/\">the strength of sensitivity</a>, Shapland writes:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>To be thin-skinned is to feel keenly, to perceive things that might go unseen, unnoticed, that others might prefer not to notice.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>What she notices above all are the connections between things, the Rube Goldberg machine of consequences that binds past and future, self and other, here and everywhere else. She writes about Los Alamos and Rachel Carson, about the traps of parenthood and the paradoxes of self-compassion, about mending clothes and mending hearts. Emerging from the essays is a reminder, both haunting and assuring, that in this increasingly fractured and fragmented world, life remains defiantly indivisible. </p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/11/16/at-the-drop-of-a-cat/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/atthedropofacat7.jpg?w=725&#038;ssl=1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Violeta Lópiz from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/11/16/at-the-drop-of-a-cat/\"><em>At the Drop of a Cat</em></a></figcaption></figure>\\n<p>There is power in such porousness &#8212; a heightened ability to question the structures that make for fragmentation, perhaps none more tyrannical than the idea that the nuclear family is the optimal unit of belonging and connection, an idea rooted in <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/05/22/alan-lightman-accidental-universe-impermanence/\">our touching yearning for immortality despite our creaturely finitude</a>: passing on our genes and values as a way of perpetuating ourselves beyond our mortal limits. Watching her friends freeze their eggs and go through rounds of IVF, Shapland reflects:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>If we extend our idea of family beyond the individual to the wider world of creatures and ecosystems, we can begin to ask what we want for them. From them. We can begin to see ourselves in relation. Acknowledging and reckoning with death &#8212; with the limit on our existence, with the fact that we are temporary &#8212; can reframe what it means to live. What do we want to leave behind? What do we want to support, maintain, in the limited time we are here?</p></blockquote>\\n<p>A beautiful answer comes from Shapland&#8217;s conversation with Marian Naranjo &#8212; a Native antinuclear activist from Santa Clara Pueblo, a stone&#8217;s throw from the birthplace of the atomic bomb. With an eye to the ancestral knowledge of how to live in peace and harmony &#8212; knowledge that has suffered the erasures of colonialism and capitalism &#8212; Naranjo envisions a new epoch of remembering what we have forgotten: how to be caretakers of connection. Sitting across from Shapland in the embodied space of mutuality, she echoes Ursula K. Le Guin&#8217;s passionate case for <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/10/21/telling-is-listening-ursula-k-le-guin-communication/\">the transformative power of real human conversation</a> and reflects:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>That’s the next circle, that circle of balance. Where we do put back our heaven and earth, our heaven back on earth. Get it back. How do we do that? It’s this, it’s talking face-to-face. It’s doing more of this.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>But somewhere along the arc of so-called progress, we forgot what indigenous cultures have known for millennia: that truth is a tapestry, no single thread of which can survive the wear and tear of reality in isolation, the reality against which truth must be continually tested in order to be true. This damaging isolationism haunts even the history of our understanding of the basic building blocks of life &#8212; the chemical elements that compose it, or discompose it. </p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_81544\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81544\" height=\"874\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/radiumdance.jpg?resize=680%2C874&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>The Radium Dance</em>, 1904.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>With an eye to the discovery of radioactivity and Marie Curie&#8217;s epochal work on radium, Shapland writes:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Soon after its discovery, radium became a multimillion-dollar business. For four decades, you could buy rejuvenating radium skin cream, lipstick, tea, bath salts, hair growth tonic, “a bag containing radium worn near the scrotum” that “was said to restore virility.” There was radium toothpaste to boost whitening. Radium therapy, called Curietherapy in France, began to be used to treat cancer. It was first inserted by fifty needles into breast tissue, or by radon “seeds” that caused serious reactions. There existed a “vaginal radium bomb consisting of a lead sphere supported by a rod for insertion” for cancer treatment. Marie and her daughter Irene <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/12/14/marie-curie-ambulance-little-curies/\">took a radiological car to the front in World War I to X-ray soldiers</a>. Later, she supplied radium bulbs to the French health service to treat the military and civilian wounded and sick with radium therapy. </p>\\n<p>The discovery of radioactivity is a story of willful ignorance, of knowing but longing not to know, pretending not to know, how powerful and damaging it was. Scientists and salespeople alike believed in its power to cure, to heal. Radium was damaging enough to kill cancer, to burn Pierre’s skin through the glass vial in his vest pocket, but somehow not thought to be damaging enough to kill the scientists handling it all day, the people brushing their teeth with it. Marie kept a vial on her nightstand to bask in its glow as she slept. She called it her child.</p>\\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\\n<p>This scientific refusal to believe what is obvious because it cannot be proven, because it is technically uncertain, accompanies our understanding of toxic substances to this day.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>This blindness to connection, causality, and the consequences of radioactivity is hardly surprising: To achieve what she achieved, against the odds of her time and place, Marie Curie <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/04/19/einstein-curie-letter/\">had to be thick-skinned</a>. Perhaps a thinner skin, with its attendant power of seeing the permeability and interdependence of things, would have saved her life, would have spared her the tragedy Adrienne Rich captured so poignantly in the final words of her <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/05/02/rosanne-cash-adrienne-rich-marie-curie/\">magnificent tribute to Curie</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>She died&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a famous woman&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;denying<br />\\nher wounds<br />\\ndenying<br />\\nher wounds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the same source as her power</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Complement with Marie Howe&#8217;s poem <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/04/23/singularity-marie-howe-animated/\">&#8220;Singularity&#8221;</a> &#8212; a stunning antidote to our illusion of separateness &#8212; and the young poet Marissa Davis&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/03/04/singularity-marissa-davis-toshi-reagon/\">inspired echo of it</a>, serenading our elemental bond with nature and each other.  </p>\\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the outgrown name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).

Two centuries before him, Goethe found great artistic inspiration in the young science of meteorology.

Part of this is due to the optical superiority of the human retina, whose dynamic range of color and light sensitivity vastly exceeds that of a camera &#8212; the eye is constantly moving between different regions of the view, dynamically adjusting to variations in brightness and darkness, while the smartphone camera relies on a static algorithm for color adjustment; as the blue light of dusk enters the sky, it attempts to auto-correct the white balance by overcompensating in the opposite direction, adding extra yellow that turns the pinks orange. &#8220;The Sun&#8217;s Light when he unfolds it,&#8221; Blake wrote, &#8220;Depends on the Organ that beholds it.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>But much of it is due to <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/05/28/arthur-zajonc-catching-the-light/\">the entwined history of vision and consciousness</a> &#8212; it is consciousness, not optics, that ultimately renders the breathtaking beauty of a sunset. Unlike a camera lens, the human eye moves dynamically across a scene, taking in not a single image but a multitude of images with varying exposures and color balances, which the brain then composites and superimposes near-instantaneously into the sunset you see. </p>\\n<p>A camera paints with optics, but an artist paints with consciousness.</p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_81526\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81526\" height=\"451\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/KnudBaade_clouds9.jpg?resize=680%2C451&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Cloud Study</em>, 1838.

It draws no attention to itself, though it is always secretly there. It is what illuminates our minds to see beauty, our desire to seek possibility, and our hearts to love life. Without this subtle quickening our days would be empty and wearisome, and no horizon would ever awaken our longing. Our passion for life is quietly sustained from somewhere in us that is wedded to the energy and excitement of life. This shy inner light is what enables us to recognize and receive our very presence here as blessing.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>The even greater blessing is our presence here together, as mirrors and magnifiers of each other&#8217;s light. &#8220;Whenever you give a blessing, a blessing returns to enfold you,&#8221; O&#8217;Donohue reminds us. At their best, at their rarest, those moments of profound light-to-light connection are thresholds, portals to transformation, invitations to a more radiant life. </p>\\n<p>With an eye to &#8220;that tenuous territory of change that we must traverse when a threshold invites us,&#8221; O&#8217;Donohue writes:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Without warning, thresholds can open directly before our feet&#8230; In the ecstasy and loneliness of one’s life, there are certain times when blessing is nearer to us.</p></blockquote>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_81493\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81493\" height=\"1161\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/EdwinAustinAbbey_SpiritOfLight.jpg?resize=680%2C1161&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"680\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Figure study for <em>The Spirit of Light</em>, Edwin Austin Abbey, 1989.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>To step across the threshold with courage and openheartedness is to honor the truth and sanctity of our experience, of our light &#8212; it is to bless ourselves:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>The structures of our experience are the windows into the divine.
